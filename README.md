An Android app that acts as companion to feeders. It's not about showing information about planes, but about feeders!

Currently only supports data via https://www.adsbexchange.com/

Features:

* Show currently tracked aircraft count per feeder
* Show tracked aircrafts and which feeder can see them

More features to come :).

## Setup

* Setup your feeder
* Install the [ADS-B exchange stats package](https://github.com/adsbxchange/adsbexchange-stats)
* Enter the [short ID you got from the stats package](https://github.com/adsbxchange/adsbexchange-stats) into the app
